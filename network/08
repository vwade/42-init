If we run host 'slash16.org' then run host on the IP address returned by our first query, one of which was found to be '99.84.231.140', we will then see that this site is hosted by cloudfront.net. Googling this gives us information on this server address, which leads us to find that this site is hosted on Amazon Cloud Services. If we do a query using 'whois', the results returned give us sever urls containing the AWS prefix, which is analogous to Amazon Cloud Services.
